# Helsinki Weather App

Python app that retrieves weather data for Helsinki from the yr.no API and displays it in a clear, user-friendly format.

I want to develop a straightforward tool that allows me to check the weather directly from the command line. My primary motivation for this choice is because I am totally fixated with the command line, as it consistently behaves as expected. Also Python & Robot Framework nerdery is something that I just enjoy!

# Todo

- Format: 3x {date, time} {temperature} {rain/norain}
- Tests with Robot Framework
- CI/CD
