# Helsinki Weather App

Python app that retrieves weather data for Helsinki from the yr.no API and displays it in a clear, user-friendly format.

I want to develop a straightforward tool that allows me to check the weather directly from the command line. 
My primary motivation for this project is my obsession with the command line: it is by far my favourite UI. 
Also a good chance for some Python & Robot Framework nerdery!

## Todo

- Cleanup the print in app.py
- Tests with Robot Framework
- CI/CD

## Instructions

Run the app

```
python3 app.py
```

Install Robot Framework in a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install robotframework
robot --version
```
