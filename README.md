# Helsinki Weather App

Python app that retrieves weather data for Helsinki from the yr.no API and displays it in a clear, user-friendly format.

![Screencap from the app](/commandline-screencap.png)

I want to develop a straightforward tool that allows me to check the weather directly from the command line. I am obsessed with the command line
and want to create my own tools for it. Also a good chance for some Python & Robot Framework nerdery!

## Todo

- Tests with Robot Framework
- Okay okay, maybe there could be a web UI as well?
  - Weather statistics included?
- CI/CD??

## Instructions

Run the app

```
python3 app.py
```

Install Robot Framework in a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install robotframework
robot --version
```
